# About Me

I am a data analyst with remote sensing and GIS experience where I clean, analyze, and visualize data to show and communicate actionable results. The ability to learn quickly, communicate effectively, and attention to detail are my top skills.
 
Geospatial analysis is a cutting edge and innovative field that can be used in solving the current challenges that our world is facing where data driven solutions is necessary. With my unique background in geography & environmental science, geospatial analysis, and international work experience I can develop products and solutions for client needs and organization goals.
 
When I’m not working, I enjoy trying new foods, photography, flying my drone, and exploring the world!
